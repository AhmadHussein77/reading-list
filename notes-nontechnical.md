Page xv
> But as I  look back, it seems clear to me that I learned the most

> skeptical sense in you, then you cannot distinguish the promising ideas
>from the worthless ones.

Page 317
> When, through indifference, inattention, incompetence, or fear of
> skepticism, we discourage children from science, we are disenfranchising
> them, taking from them the tools needed to manage their future.

Page 322
> I'd guess that it's partly peer pressure not to excel (except in sports);
> partly that the society teacher short-term gratification; partly the
> impression that science or mathematics won't buy you a sports car; partly
> that so little is expected of students; and partly that there are few
> rewards or role models for intelligent discussion of science and
> technoloogy - or even for learning for its own sake.

Page 323
> What's wrong with admitting that we don't know something? Is our 
> self-esteem so fragile?

Page 325
> Evidence has little to do with it: What they wish to be true, they believe
> is true.

> The problems in public education in science and other subjects run so

Page 406
> If we do not know what we're capable of, we cannot appreciate measures
> taken to protect us from ourselves.

Page 413
> If we're absolutely sure that our beliefs are right, and those of others
> wrong; that we are motivated by good, and others by evil;  that the King
> of the Universe speaks to us, and not to adherents of very different
> faiths; that it is wicked to challenge conventional doctrines or to ask
> searching questions; that our main job is to believe and obey - then the
> witch mania will recur in its infinite variations down to the time of the
> last man.

Page 434
> In every country, we should be teaching our children the scientific method
> and the reasons for a Bill of Rights. With it comes a certain decency,
> humility and community spirit. In the demon-haunted world that we inhabit
> by virtue of being human, this may be all that stands between us and the
> enveloping darkness.
