# Reading List

Welcome to my reading list!

The idea behind this is to have something more lightweight than
[Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/) (or related sites)
in an environment I'm comfortable in.

## Content and Navigation

+ __Notes__ on books I have read.
  + [Nontechnical Books](
      http://github.com/bamos/reading-list/blob/master/notes-nontechnical.md)
  + [Technical Books](
      http://github.com/bamos/reading-list/blob/master/notes-technical.md)
+ A [list](http://github.com/bamos/reading-list/blob/master/to-read.md)
  of books I want to read.

## Suggest Something!

Please suggest something via an issue (or however you desire) if you're
reading this!

## Inspiration

Among my few friends who give me reading suggestions (whom I am thankful
for), I've found the following sources both useful and inspirational.
